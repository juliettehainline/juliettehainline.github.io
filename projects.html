        <p class="text-left">I am a versatile developer and thinker, eager to learn. I can program with strong familiarity in C, Swift, HTML/CSS, and Typed Racket. I have working knowledge of Python and Javascript. I have primarily worked on school projects with low-level systems, such as building my own shell simulator or TCP simulator. My side projects are primarily front-end development. I'm getting more involved with iOS development! Stay tuned for more projects coming soon :)</p>

        <p class = "text-left">G.U.R.L. is a responsive, imaginative resource portal to help girls imagine themselves as computer scientists using HTML/CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap. Similar to a Buzzfeed Quiz, a user would pick their education level, their interests, their learning style, and would be matched with a female tech superstar as well as various vetted education resources. We were a winner out of 100 participants for the Women in Tech Demo Day 2016 sponsored by Capital One.

        <p class = "text-left">B.S. Breaker is a brick breaker-style game in which the player attempts to destroy a certain politician's tweets. My team used the Twitter API to gather recent tweets and input them into a Firebase database. We gave each tweet a "b.s. rating" using sentiment analysis using NaiveBayesClassifier to determine levels of the game. With no background in Python, we ended up diving into game development (using Pygame), the Twitter API, and machine learning. We were one of twelve winning finalists out of 1,000 participants at Hack the North 2016 at the University of Waterloo.
