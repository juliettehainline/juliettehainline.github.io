        <p class="text-left">I truly believe that the arts are necessary to bring humanity together and to allow creativity to flourish. After inching my way to the piano as a child, I started classical piano lessons at the age of 4. After constantly singing in the shower, my mom made me audition for the <a class=goodies-link href=https://www.metopera.org/About/Auditions/Childrens-Chorus/ target="_blank">Metropolitan Opera Children's Chorus</a>. I fell in love with the power of music and performing. This manifested itself in dance as well: I did ballet for 10 years and ballroom danced with the <a class=goodies-link href=http://www.dancingclassrooms.org/ target="_blank">American Ballroom Theater's Youth Dance Company</a>. I was priviliged enough to sing with Ren√©e Fleming and dance with my friends at Jacob's Pillow. This performing love continued through high school where I performed in various musicals and sang at Lincoln Center with my high school chorus. I made playlists at <a class=goodies-link href=https://www.wired.com/2015/12/songza-is-dead-but-it-lives-on-within-google-play-music/ target="_blank">Songza</a> as an intern, now Google Play Music, which I continue on <a class=goodies-link href=https://open.spotify.com/user/12127147318 target="_blank">Spotify</a>. I was a House Manager at <a class=goodies-link href=https://chicagopresents.uchicago.edu/ target="_blank">University of Chicago Presents</a>, a world reknowed classical music series. I now sing when I can in jazz combos, annoy my roommates when I take a shower, and overtake the dance floor at any party.</p>
